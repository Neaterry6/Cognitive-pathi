## üìä Architecture

### Backend Structure
- `server/routes.ts` - API routes and business logic
- `server/storage.ts` - Database operations using Drizzle ORM
- `server/services/` - External API integrations (Wikipedia, ALOC)
- `shared/schema.ts` - Database schema and TypeScript types

### Frontend Structure
- `client/src/pages/` - React components for different app sections
- `client/src/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components (shadcn/ui)
- `client/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for state management

### Key Components
- **Enhanced Study Plan**: AI-generated study content with quiz integration
- **CBT Mode**: Practice quiz interface with timer and scoring
- **Wiki Research**: Wikipedia search with image support and content extraction
- **Dashboard**: User progress overview and subject selection

## üîß Configuration

### Database Schema
The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. Key tables:
- `users` - User accounts and progress
- `subjects` - Available study subjects
- `quiz_sessions` - Quiz attempts and scores  
- `study_progress` - Individual topic completion
- `explained_questions` - AI explanations history

### API Integrations
- **ALOC API**: Real-time POST UTME questions
- **Wikipedia API**: Educational content and research materials
- **OpenAI/Gemini**: AI-powered content generation and explanations

## üöÄ Deployment

### Render Deployment

1. **Create `render.yaml`**:
   ```yaml
   services:
     - type: web
       name: cognitive-path
       env: node
       buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
       startCommand: npm start
       envVars:
         - key: NODE_ENV
           value: production
         - key: DATABASE_URL
           fromDatabase:
             name: cognitive-path-db
             property: connectionString
   
   databases:
     - name: cognitive-path-db
       databaseName: cognitive_path
       user: cognitive_path_user
   ```

2. **Deploy to Render**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables in Render dashboard
   - Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Vercel Deployment

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
